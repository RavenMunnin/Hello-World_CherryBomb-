# Hello-World_CherryBomb-
Test of the emergency Broadcast system
I am not some one who likes to talk about myself, so I won't. 
I do feel completly overwelmed by the insane possiblites and 
complexity of programing. All it really is, commuication, talking 
to, and about things in the world, and I still can't do it. 
Damm you English Majors!!!!
