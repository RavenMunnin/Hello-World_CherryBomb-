# Hello-World_CherryBomb-
Test of the emergency Broadcast system.
I am not some one who likes to talk about myself, so I won't.
I do feel completly overwelmed by the insane possiblites and 
complexity of programing. It's all just communication. Talking 
to, and about things in the world. It's so simple and basic, I still can't do it. 
Damm you English Majors!!!!
P.S.
Ok technically this is about me so I guess I did accomplish the first part of the 
requirements.
